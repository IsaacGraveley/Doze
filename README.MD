# Description
##### Doze is A transit app that will wake you up when youâ€™re almost at your stop, keep you alert on any updates regarding TTC and delays, and give them a news feed to keep up with different news updates. 

## Key features of Doze

1. Wake passengers up two stops before theirs so they can sleep on their commute. 

2. Use the TTC API to alert the user of delays that are happening with the systems / status of trains/buses. 

3. Make a news feed for the Toronto area so users always have something to read, maybe using another API from a news source or at least from a firebase database.
